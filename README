# Code has UI, DB back end 
UI is made out of html and java script files (index.html and app.js)
DB is sqlalchemy and can be access via postgress (see below)
** Warning : DB is not permanent so make sure to archive
Tree uses Plotly to draw the graph

Run a SQL script file: \i /path/to/file.sql

## ARCHIVING

to restore it:

## to run stand alone load from txt to DB using the FastAPI importer module 
bash
docker compose run --rm api python -m app.importers.import_family_tree /app/data/gezaweldeamlak.txt

## Todo
Allow Person to be edited as a new menu option when node is selected

When a new node is added ensure to highlight that so it it is easier to see and can be linked to a parent
Add functinoality to expert the graph to a file 
Support for Spouse/Parent relationships
